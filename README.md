Because lately i've read a lot about ddd, dci, event sourcing and cqrs and wanted to tast the flavor and see how it feels in live,
I decided to create a simple app to experiment that way of structuring code.

It'll be a pingpong app as everyone knows that every good company has a pingpong table.
I called it jean-michel in reference of [Jean-michel Saive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Saive)

In this case i wont go to cqrs and es at first as i'm not sure i'll be useful for now, but that might come later in the game.

This is just an experimentation so feel free to share your thoughts (even the nasty ones) and fork it

I'll try to stick to TDD and BDD as much as possible, but everyone know that when it gets too exiting we use to forget about that, so hit me up if you feels i'm getting too excited.
